# Text-Mode-Graphics-Controller-Through-VGA-HDMI-Output
In this lab, we designed a simplified graphics controller that supports 80-column text mode through HDMI output. For the first part of the lab, we will implement the controller to support a background and a foreground color for our text using registers to store the displayed characters. For the second part, we extended the implementation to support displaying 16 colors on the screen at the same time with control over each characterâ€™s background and foreground color using on-chip-memory to account for the extension of the VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) and allow for more capabilities.
